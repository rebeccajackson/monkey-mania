# Monkey Mania

## Overview
This idea for this project was to create something fun building on the skills we had learnt at the time.
The monkeys all start with a hunger level that goes down over time and an average hunger level indicator bar for all monkeys. Clicking on the bananas above a monkey would feed it, and the goal is to ensure that all monkeys don't fall off the branch from becoming too hungry.

## Tech used
- JavaScript
- React
- CSS (Grid, Flexbox and animations)
